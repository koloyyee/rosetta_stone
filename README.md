# Learn through Projects

Learn programming language via projects.
This is based on [Project book](https://projectbook.code.brettchalupa.com/_introduction.html), this repo is a modern take on the Pragmatic Programmer classic [57 Exercises Book](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers/)

## How does it work?

My learning programming method is based on The Primegean's 5 steps method:

1. AoC
2. Official Doc
3. Small project - HTTP, Text Adventure ( based of another YouTuber [Code with Huw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SKVQyA4TjU))
4. WebSocket

For more in-depth and general challenge I am using the project book challenges give me some ideas,n ot all the challenges will be done but certainly from small cli to basic applications, this is fun small challenges, and if the project is big enough it will turn into a standalone repo.

## Divide by project and split by language
